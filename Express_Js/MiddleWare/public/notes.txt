This is a simple project I have created to check 
whether backend and frontend are perfectly incorporated or not.
 So this is how the code works from the developer POV:

I have created an HTML tag where I have defined the logic, 
where a form tag is created which has 2 attributes:

Endpoint (the door at which the port is employed to listen to the query).

HTTP method (at which method it got submitted).
 When I have the access of the body through middleware, 
 this method is entitled to that method.

Inside that, I have created 2 tags,
 and the input tag has an attribute named as email, 
 which would be accessible once the request body has complied with 
 the body parser middleware.

In the index.js, I have added and implemented npm.

Step 1: Define the port (where the server will listen).

Then add all the essential tools of npm.

Use 2 HTTP methods:

For GET: I have used a file directory so that 
the HTML part will be rendered 
as soon as the user lands on the server vicinity.

For POST: Define the set with submit method == form tag and
 add the middleware(i have used body parser which is a pre-processing 
 types), whose role is to govern the preemptive strike 
 through the req.body and display the value pressed by the user.

And finally, Postman is being used to stimulate the user behaviour.
