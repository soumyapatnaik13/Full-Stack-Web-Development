JavaScript is being used in the Chrome tools.
 Many options were introduced into that specific environment 
 and are too wonkish. Even relatively smaller functionalities 
 require verbose writing, so jQuery was introduced. 
 It makes JS tasks easier.

Simply when we write:
document.querySelector("h1") == $("h1") == jQuery("h1")

jQuery is a library, which means some developers have already written
 the code, and we can just use it by implementing the library.
